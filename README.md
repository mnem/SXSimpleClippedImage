SXSimpleClippedImage
====================

Simple extension of SPImage which allows you to clip a rectangular area
within an SPImage. Any parts of the SPImage outside the clip area will 
not be visible.

It behaves in a similar fashion to a rectangular mask in Flash, although
this version always draws the visible pixel area from location of the 
SPImage on screen. I may fix that, although I'm not certain which
behaviour I prefer yet.
